# react-native-horizontal-list

The React Native Horizontal List package is a versatile and efficient solution for implementing horizontal lists in your React Native applications. I tried to fix the RTL issue on the FlatList, empowering developers to create sleek and responsive horizontal scrollable lists, and enhancing the user experience with seamless navigation through a collection of items.
