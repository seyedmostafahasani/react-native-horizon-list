# react-native-horizon-list

The React Native Horizon List package is a versatile and efficient solution for implementing horizontal lists in your React Native applications. I tried to fix the RTL issue on the FlatList on Android devices, empowering developers to create sleek and responsive horizontal scrollable lists, and enhancing the user experience with seamless navigation through a collection of items.
