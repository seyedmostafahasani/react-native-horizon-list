# react-native-horizon-list

The React Native Horizontal List package is a versatile and efficient solution for implementing horizontal lists in your React Native applications. I tried to fix the RTL issue on the FlatList, empowering developers to create sleek and responsive horizontal scrollable lists, and enhancing the user experience with seamless navigation through a collection of items.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-horizon-list
```

## Usage

```js
import { multiply } from 'react-native-horizon-list';

// ...

const result = await multiply(3, 7);
```
